Day 2 - Network Fundamentals
Source: TryHackMe - Pre Security Path
Room: Module 2 - Network Fundamentals
Date: 23/02/2026
Time spent: 18 hours
Tasks completed: 5/5 rooms

What I Learned:

* Learnt about What is Networking including the Internet, how devices communicate, and the importance of IP addresses and MAC addresses.

* Understood LAN (Local Area Network) topologies including Star, Bus, and Ring topology, and learned about network devices like routers, switches, and hubs.

* Learnt about the OSI Model and its 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application, and how data flows through each layer.

* Understood Packets and Frames including their structure, how data is encapsulated at different layers, TCP 3-way handshake, and the difference between TCP and UDP protocols.

* Learnt about Extending Your Network covering port forwarding, firewalls, VPN (Virtual Private Network), and how networks can be connected across different locations.

* Understood key networking concepts like subnetting, private vs public IP addresses, and common port numbers (HTTP 80, HTTPS 443, SSH 22, FTP 21).

Key Takeaways:

* Grasped how data travels through networks using the OSI model as a reference.

* Understood the difference between Layer 2 (Data Link - MAC addresses) and Layer 3 (Network - IP addresses).

* Learned that TCP is reliable but slower while UDP is faster but unreliable.

* Realized the importance of network security through firewalls and proper network segmentation.

Questions/Confusions:

* Still confused about subnetting calculations and CIDR notation.

* Need more clarity on the difference between routers and switches in practical scenarios.

* Confused about how VPN encryption actually works.

Next Session:

* Start Module 3: How The Web Works
* Learn about DNS and HTTP/HTTPS
* Understand how websites function
